# Regex in Python

## Regular Expressions in Python Programming Language:
Regular expressions (regex) in Python are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. They allow developers to search, match, and manipulate strings based on specific patterns, making them invaluable for tasks like data validation, text parsing, and string extraction.Refer to a comprehensive tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/regular-expressions-in-python-programming-language">Regular Expressions in Python</a> to read about the code sample of this section in detail.


## Regex Character Sets in Python:
Regex character sets in Python allow specifying a set of characters to match at a particular position in a string. They provide flexibility in matching multiple characters in a single position, reducing the need for long and complex patterns.A detailed explanation of the code samples for this section are given in an all inclusive tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/character-sets-in-python">Regex Character Sets</a>.


## Regex Anchors in Python:
Regex anchors in Python are special characters used to match positions within a string, not specific characters. They include `^` to match the start of a string and `$` to match the end, allowing precise pattern matching at the beginning or end of lines.An elaborate tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/regex-anchors-in-python">Regex Anchors</a> gives a better understanding of the code samples for this section.


## Regex Word Boundary in Python:
Regex word boundaries in Python, represented by `\b`, allow matching patterns only at the boundary between word characters and non-word characters. They are useful for finding whole words and avoiding partial matches.The code samples given above for this section are explained elaborately in the tutorial on the topic <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/regex-word-boundary-in-python">Regex Word Boundary</a>.


## Regex Greedy Quantifiers in Python:
Greedy quantifiers in Python regex are used to match as much of the string as possible while still allowing the overall pattern to match. Examples include `*` to match zero or more occurrences and `+` to match one or more occurrences.Elaborate explanation of the code for this section can be read from the <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/regex-greedy-quantifiers-in-python">Greedy Quantifiers in Python</a> tutorial.


## Regex Non-greedy Quantifiers in Python:
Non-greedy quantifiers in Python regex, denoted by `*?`, `+?`, etc., match as little of the string as possible while still allowing the overall pattern to match. They are useful for matching the shortest possible substring that satisfies the pattern.Refer to an elaborate tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/regex-non-greedy-quantifiers-in-python">Non-greedy Quantifiers in Python</a> to read about the code sample of this section in detail.


## Regex Sets & Ranges in Python:
Regex sets and ranges in Python allow specifying multiple characters to match at a particular position. They provide a concise way to define a group of characters and simplify pattern matching in complex situations.An elaborate explanation of the code samples for this section are given in an comprehensive tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/regex-sets-ranges-in-python">Regex Sets & Ranges in Python</a>.


## Regex Capturing Groups in Python:
Regex capturing groups in Python are used to extract specific parts of a matched string. By enclosing a part of the pattern in parentheses, it becomes a capturing group, allowing developers to retrieve the matched text easily.The all inclusive tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/regex-capturing-groups-in-python">Capturing Groups in Python</a> explains the code sample given above for this section elaborately.


## Regex Backreferences in Python:
Regex backreferences in Python allow reusing previously matched text within the same regex pattern. They enable matching repeated occurrences of the same text, reducing redundancy and simplifying pattern creation.The elaborate tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/regex-backreferences-in-python">Regex Backreferences in Python</a> gives a better understanding of the code samples for this section.


## Regex Alternation in Python:
Regex alternation in Python, represented by the `|` symbol, allows specifying multiple alternative patterns. It matches any of the alternatives, providing flexibility in pattern matching and branching based on different conditions.The tutorial <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/regex-alternation-in-python">Regex Alternation in Python</a> explains the code sample given above for this section in detail.


## Regex Non-capturing Groups in Python:
Regex non-capturing groups in Python, denoted by `(?:...)`, are similar to capturing groups but do not store the matched text in memory. They are used for grouping without creating a backreference and can improve performance for complex patterns.Refer to the tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/regex-non-capturing-groups-in-python">Non-capturing Groups in Python</a> to read about the code sample of this section in detail.


## Regex Lookahead in Python:
Regex lookahead in Python allows asserting that a pattern must or must not be followed by another pattern without including the latter in the match. Positive lookahead is represented by `(?=...)`, while negative lookahead is represented by `(?!...)`.A detailed explanation of the code samples for this section are included in the tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/regex-lookahead-in-python">Regex Lookahead in Python</a>.


## Regex Lookbehind in Python:
Regex lookbehind in Python allows asserting that a pattern must or must not be preceded by another pattern without including the latter in the match. Positive lookbehind is represented by `(?<=...)`, while negative lookbehind is represented by `(?<!...)`.The tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/regex-lookbehind-in-python">Regex Lookbehind in Python</a> gives a better understanding of the code samples for this section.
