# Closures and decorators in Python


## Using Functions as First-Class Objects in Python Programming Language:
In Python, functions are considered first-class objects, which means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned from functions. This powerful feature enables functional programming paradigms and enhances code flexibility and reusability.An elaborate tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/using-functions-as-first-class-objects-in-python-programming-language">Functions as First-Class Objects</a> gives a better understanding of the code samples for this section.


## Closures in Python Programming Language:
Closures in Python are nested functions that capture and remember the environment in which they are created. They can access variables from their containing function even after the containing function has finished executing. Closures are useful for creating specialized and self-contained functions.The code samples given above for this section are explained elaborately in the tutorial on the topic <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/closures-in-python-programming-language">Closures in Python</a>.


## Decorators in Python Programming Language:
Decorators in Python are higher-order functions that modify the behavior of other functions. They allow adding functionality to existing functions without modifying their code. Decorators are commonly used for logging, authentication, and code pre-processing.Elaborate explanation of the code for this section can be read from the <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/decorators-in-python-programming-language">Decorators in Python</a> tutorial.


## Decorators with Arguments in Python:
Python decorators can also take arguments, allowing them to be more versatile and configurable. By using nested functions, decorators can accept additional parameters to customize the behavior they add to the decorated functions.Refer to an elaborate tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/decorators-with-arguments-in-python">Decorators with Arguments</a> to read about the code sample of this section in detail.


## Class Decorators in Python:
In addition to function decorators, Python also supports class decorators. Class decorators modify the behavior of classes rather than individual functions. They can be used to alter class attributes, methods, or implement additional functionality to classes.An elaborate explanation of the code samples for this section are given in an comprehensive tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/class-decorators-in-python">Class Decorators</a>.


## Property Decorators in Python Programming Language:
Property decorators in Python enable the creation of computed or dynamic attributes for classes. They allow you to access, set, or delete attributes through methods, providing control and validation over attribute access.The all inclusive tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/property-decorators-in-python-programming-language">Property Decorators</a> explains the code sample given above for this section elaborately.


## Named Tuples in Python:
Named tuples in Python are lightweight data structures that behave like regular tuples but have named fields, making code more readable and self-documenting. Named tuples provide a concise way to define small data structures without the overhead of creating custom classes.The elaborate tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/named-tuples-in-python">Named Tuples</a> gives a better understanding of the code samples for this section.


## Context Managers in Python:
Context managers in Python are objects that enable resource management through the `with` statement. They ensure that resources are acquired and released properly, even in the presence of exceptions or errors, promoting clean and safe resource management in Python.The tutorial <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/context-managers-in-python">Context Managers in Python</a> explains the code sample given above for this section in detail.
