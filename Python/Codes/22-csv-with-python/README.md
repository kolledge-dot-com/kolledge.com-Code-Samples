# Working with CSV in python

## Python for CSV Files:
CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are a common way to store and exchange tabular data. Python provides built-in modules to work with CSV files efficiently, making it easy to read, write, and manipulate data in this popular format.

## Reading CSV Files in Python Programming Language:
To read data from a CSV file in Python, we use the `csv.reader` or `pandas` library, depending on the complexity of the data. CSV reader functions allow extracting data from rows and columns for further processing.Refer to the tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/reading-csv-files-in-python-programming-language">Reading CSV Files in Python</a> to read about the code sample of this section in detail.


## Writing to CSV Files in Python Programming Language:
Writing data to a CSV file in Python involves using the `csv.writer` or `pandas` library. It allows adding data to the file, row by row, creating a structured and easily readable CSV output. This capability is helpful for saving analysis results or generating reports in CSV format.A detailed explanation of the code samples for this section are included in the tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/writing-to-csv-files-in-python-programming-language">Writing to CSV Files</a>.
