# Exception handling in python

## What is Exception Handling in Python Programming Language:
Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to deal with runtime errors and exceptional conditions that may occur during program execution. It allows developers to gracefully handle errors and prevent program crashes, improving code robustness and user experience.

## Try-Except Blocks in Python Programming Language:
Try-except blocks in Python are used to handle exceptions. Code inside the try block is executed, and if an exception occurs, it is caught by the appropriate except block. This prevents the program from terminating abruptly and allows controlled error handling.The all inclusive tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/try-except-blocks-in-python-programming-language">Try-Except Blocks</a> explains the code sample given above for this section elaborately.

## Finally Block in Python Programming Language:
The finally block in Python is used in conjunction with try-except blocks. It contains code that is guaranteed to execute, whether an exception occurs or not. Finally blocks are useful for performing cleanup tasks and resource management.The elaborate tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/finally-block-in-python-programming-language">Finally Block</a> gives a better understanding of the code samples for this section.

## Try..Except..Else Construct in Python:
The try-except-else construct in Python extends the try-except block. Code inside the else block executes only if there is no exception raised in the try block. It is used when there are specific actions to be taken if no exception occurs.The tutorial <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/try-except-else-in-python">Try..Except..Else Construct</a> explains the code sample given above for this section in detail.

## Raising Exceptions in Python Programming Language:
Raising exceptions in Python allows developers to intentionally trigger errors or exceptional situations based on specific conditions. It enables custom error handling and helps communicate exceptional situations to users or other parts of the code.Refer to the tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/raising-exceptions-in-python-programming-language">Raising Exceptions in Python</a> to read about the code sample of this section in detail.

## Built-in Exceptions in Python Programming Language:
Python provides a set of built-in exceptions that cover various types of runtime errors. These exceptions include `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, and more. Understanding built-in exceptions helps identify and handle specific error cases.A detailed explanation of the code samples for this section are included in the tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/built-in-exceptions-in-python-programming-language">Built-in Exceptions in Python</a>.

## User-Defined Exceptions in Python Programming Language:
Python allows developers to create custom exceptions by defining new classes that inherit from the `Exception` class. User-defined exceptions are useful when dealing with application-specific errors or exceptional conditions that require specialized handling.The tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/user-defined-exceptions-in-python-programming-language">User-Defined Exceptions in Python</a> gives a better understanding of the code samples for this section.
