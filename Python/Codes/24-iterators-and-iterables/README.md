# Iterators and iterables in python

## Iterators vs. Iterables in Python:
In Python, iterators and iterables are essential concepts for working with loops and collections. An iterable is an object that can be iterated over, such as lists or strings. An iterator is an object that produces values from an iterable one by one, allowing sequential processing of elements.A comprehensive tutorial on the topic <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/iterators-in-python-programming-language">Iterators vs. Iterables</a> explains the code samples of this section in more detail.


## Iter() Function in Python:
The `iter()` function in Python is used to obtain an iterator from an iterable. It allows converting collections like lists, tuples, or strings into iterators, enabling iterative processing of elements using the `next()` function.The code samples given above for this section are explained in detailed in a comprehensive tutorial on the topic <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/iter-function-in-python">Iter() Function in Python</a>.


## Custom Sequence Type in Python:
In Python, custom sequence types are user-defined classes that behave like built-in sequences (e.g., lists or tuples). Implementing custom sequence types involves defining methods like `__getitem__()` and `__len__()`, enabling object slicing and indexing. This provides flexibility in data representation and manipulation.Thorough understanding of the code for this section can be gained from an all inclusive tutorial on the topic <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/custom-sequence-type-in-python">Custom Sequence Type</a>.
