# Python Modules and packages


## Modules in Python Programming Language:
Modules in Python are files containing Python code that can be imported into other Python programs. They allow code organization, reusability, and modularity. Modules enable developers to break code into smaller, manageable pieces and promote collaborative development.The step by step tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/modules-in-python-programming-language">Modules in Python</a> throws more light on the topic and the code samples.

## Creating Modules in Python Programming Language:
Creating modules in Python involves defining functions, classes, and variables in a separate Python file. The module's functionality can then be used in other programs by importing it using the `import` statement.The code samples given above for this section are explained in detailed in the tutorial - <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/creating-modules-in-python-programming-language">Creating Modules in Python</a>.

## Packages in Python Programming Language:
Packages in Python are directories that contain multiple modules and a special `__init__.py` file. They are used to organize related modules into a single, cohesive unit, promoting code organization and making code distribution easier.Thorough understanding of the code for this section can be gained from the <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/packages-in-python-programming-language">Packages in Python</a> tutorial.

## Creating Packages in Python Programming Language:
Creating packages in Python involves creating a directory with a meaningful name and adding related modules to it. The presence of the `__init__.py` file inside the package directory makes it a valid Python package.A comprehensive tutorial on the topic <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/creating-packages-in-python-programming-language">Creating Packages in Python</a> explains the code samples of this section in more detail.

## Difference Between Module and Package in Python:
In Python, a module is a single Python file containing code, while a package is a directory containing multiple modules and an `__init__.py` file. Modules allow code reuse, while packages promote code organization and distribution by grouping related modules together.
