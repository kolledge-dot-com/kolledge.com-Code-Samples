# Python functions - more  features


## Anonymous Functions in Python programming language:
Anonymous functions, also known as lambda functions, are functions without a defined name. They are created using the `lambda` keyword and are often used for short, one-line operations. Lambda functions provide a concise way to define small, throwaway functions and are commonly used in functional programming.Refer to an all inclusive tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/anonymous-functions-in-python-programming-language">Anonymous Functions in Python</a> to read about the code sample of this section in detail.

## Lambda Expressions in Python programming language:
Lambda expressions, or lambda functions, are concise and anonymous functions that can be defined in a single line using the `lambda` keyword. They are useful for quick, one-time operations, especially when passed as arguments to higher-order functions or used in situations where a named function is not necessary.Refer to a comprehensive tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/lambda-function-in-python-programming-language">Lambda Expressions</a> to read about the code sample of this section in detail.

## Unpacking Tuples in Python:
Unpacking tuples in Python allows assigning multiple variables at once from the elements of a tuple. This powerful feature enables efficient and readable code, especially when working with functions that return multiple values or when dealing with data that comes in tuples.A detailed explanation of the code samples for this section are given in an all inclusive tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/unpacking-tuples-in-python-programming-language">Unpacking Tuples in Python</a>.

## Variadic Functions - using *args:
Variadic functions in Python accept a variable number of arguments, allowing flexibility when calling functions. The `*args` syntax enables developers to pass any number of positional arguments, which are then accessible within the function as a tuple. Variadic functions are particularly useful for handling situations with an uncertain number of inputs.An elaborate tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/variadic-functions-using-args-in-python">Variadic Functions</a> gives a better understanding of the code samples for this section.

## Keyword Parameters in Python:
Keyword parameters in Python allow passing arguments to functions using their parameter names. This feature enhances code clarity, as it enables developers to call functions with arguments in any order, explicitly specifying the parameter names. Keyword parameters are beneficial when dealing with functions that have numerous optional arguments.The code samples given above for this section are explained elaborately in the tutorial on the topic <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/keyword-parameters-in-python">eyword Parameters</a>.

## Keyword Arguments in Python:
Keyword arguments in Python are arguments passed to functions using their parameter names. This way, the function call is more explicit and self-explanatory, as parameter names are provided along with the values. Using keyword arguments enhances code readability, especially when dealing with functions that have multiple parameters.Elaborate explanation of the code for this section can be read from the <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/keyword-arguments-in-python-programming-language">Keyword Arguments</a> tutorial.

## Partial Functions in Python:
Partial functions in Python are a way to create new functions with fixed values for some of the parameters of an existing function. This allows the creation of specialized versions of functions while reusing code. Partial functions are helpful when adapting functions to specific use cases with default or predefined arguments.Refer to an elaborate tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/partial-functions-in-python">Partial Functions in Python</a> to read about the code sample of this section in detail.

## Recursion in Python programming language:
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, identical subproblems. Python supports recursion, and it is particularly useful for solving problems that can be broken down into self-similar subtasks.An elaborate explanation of the code samples for this section are given in an comprehensive tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/recursion-in-python-programming-language">Recursion</a>.

## Docstrings in Python:
Docstrings in Python are triple-quoted strings used to document functions, modules, classes, or methods. They provide essential information about how to use and understand the code, serving as documentation for developers and users. Well-written docstrings improve code clarity and encourage good programming practices.The all inclusive tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/docstrings-in-python">Docstrings</a> explains the code sample given above for this section elaborately.
