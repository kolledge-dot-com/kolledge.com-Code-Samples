# OOPs in Python

## Object-Oriented Programming in Python:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python is a programming paradigm that allows organizing code around objects, which are instances of classes. Python supports OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, enabling developers to create reusable and maintainable code.The all inclusive tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/object-oriented-programming-in-python">OOPs in python</a> explains the code sample given above for this section elaborately.

## Constructors in Python:
Constructors in Python are special methods that initialize objects when they are created from a class. The `__init__()` method is the constructor in Python and sets initial values for instance variables. Constructors ensure that objects start with specific states and properties.The elaborate tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/constructors-in-python">Constructors</a> gives a better understanding of the code samples for this section.

## Destructors in Python Programming Language:
Destructors in Python are special methods that are automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed or deallocated. The `__del__()` method serves as the destructor and can be used to perform cleanup tasks before the object's memory is released.The tutorial <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/destructors-in-python-programming-language">Destructors</a> explains the code sample given above for this section in detail.

## Instance Variables in Python:
Instance variables in Python are variables defined within a class and are specific to each instance (object) of the class. They represent the unique state of an object and can have different values for each instance.Refer to the tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/instance-variables-in-python-programming-language">Instance Variables</a> to read about the code sample of this section in detail.

## Class Variables in Python:
Class variables in Python are variables declared within a class but outside any method. They are shared among all instances (objects) of the class and have the same value for all instances. Class variables represent properties common to all objects of the class.A detailed explanation of the code samples for this section are included in the tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/class-variables-in-python-programming-language">Class Variables</a>.

## Instance Methods in Python:
Instance methods in Python are functions defined within a class and can access instance variables and modify object state. They take the instance (self) as the first argument and are used to perform actions specific to individual objects.The tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/instance-methods-in-python-programming-language">Instance Methods</a> gives a better understanding of the code samples for this section.

## Class Methods in Python:
Class methods in Python are methods that take the class (cls) as the first argument instead of the instance. They operate on class-level data and are used for tasks that involve the class as a whole, rather than individual instances.The step by step tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/class-methods-in-python-programming-language">Class Methods</a> throws more light on the topic and the code samples.

## Static Methods in Python Programming Language:
Static methods in Python are methods defined within a class that do not take the instance (self) or class (cls) as their first argument. They behave like regular functions and are used for utility functions that do not require access to instance or class data.The code samples given above for this section are explained in detailed in the tutorial - <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/static-methods-in-python-programming-language">Static Methods in Python</a>.

## Class Method vs. Static Method vs. Instance Method in Python:
In Python, class methods, static methods, and instance methods serve different purposes. Class methods operate on class-level data, static methods are utility functions, and instance methods work with individual object instances.

## Encapsulation in Python Programming Language:
Encapsulation in Python involves bundling data (instance variables) and methods within a class to restrict direct access to data from outside the class. It promotes data hiding, protecting object integrity and ensuring controlled access to object state.Thorough understanding of the code for this section can be gained from the <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/encapsulation-in-python-programming-language">Encapsulation in Python</a> tutorial.

## Polymorphism in Python Programming Language:
Polymorphism in Python allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent multiple data types, providing flexibility and allowing the use of objects interchangeably.A comprehensive tutorial on the topic <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/polymorphism-in-python-programming-language">Polymorphism in Python</a> explains the code samples of this section in more detail.

## Inheritance in Python:
Inheritance in Python is a mechanism that allows creating new classes (derived classes) from existing classes (base classes). Derived classes inherit properties and behaviors from base classes, promoting code reusability and enabling hierarchical relationships between classes.The code samples given above for this section are explained in detailed in a comprehensive tutorial on the topic <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/inheritance-in-python">Inheritance in Python</a>.

## Single Inheritance in Python:
Single inheritance in Python involves a class inheriting from only one base class. It forms a linear inheritance chain, where each derived class has only one direct parent class. Thorough understanding of the code for this section can be gained from an all inclusive tutorial on the topic <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/single-inheritance-in-python">Single Inheritance</a>.

## Multiple Inheritance in Python:
Multiple inheritance in Python involves a class inheriting from more than one base class. It enables a derived class to acquire properties and behaviors from multiple parent classes. Refer to an all inclusive tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/multiple-inheritance-in-python">Multiple Inheritance</a> to read about the code sample of this section in detail.

## Multilevel Inheritance in Python:
Multilevel inheritance in Python involves a chain of inheritance, where a derived class inherits from another derived class. It forms a parent-child-grandchild relationship between classes. Refer to a comprehensive tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/multilevel-inheritance-in-python">Multilevel Inheritance</a> to read about the code sample of this section in detail.

## Hierarchical Inheritance in Python:
Hierarchical inheritance in Python involves multiple derived classes inheriting from a single base class. It forms a tree-like structure, where one base class is shared among multiple derived classes. A detailed explanation of the code samples for this section are given in an all inclusive tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/hierarchical-inheritance-in-python">Hierarchical Inheritance</a>.

## Hybrid Inheritance in Python:
Hybrid inheritance in Python is a combination of different types of inheritance, such as multiple, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance. It allows creating complex class hierarchies to model real-world scenarios. An elaborate tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/hybrid-inheritance-in-python">Hybrid Inheritance</a> gives a better understanding of the code samples for this section.

## Super() Function in Python:
The `super()` function in Python is used to call a method from a base class within a derived class. It enables proper method resolution in multiple inheritance scenarios, avoiding duplicate method calls. The code samples given above for this section are explained elaborately in the tutorial on the topic <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/super-function-in-python">Super() Function in Python</a>.

## Method Overriding in Python:
Method overriding in Python allows a derived class to provide its implementation of a method inherited from the base class. The overridden method in the derived class takes precedence over the method in the base class. Elaborate explanation of the code for this section can be read from the <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/method-overriding-in-python">Method Overriding in Python</a> tutorial.

## Method Resolution Order in Python:
The Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python determines the sequence in which base classes are searched for a method during method resolution. It is essential for resolving conflicts in multiple inheritance situations.

## Issubclass() Function in Python:
The `issubclass()` function in Python is used to check if a class is a subclass of another class. It helps verify class hierarchies and inheritance relationships. Refer to an elaborate tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/issubclass-function-in-python">Issubclass() Function in Python</a> to read about the code sample of this section in detail.
