# File handling in python

## Intro to File Handling in Python Programming Language:
File handling in Python involves working with files on the filesystem. It allows reading data from files, writing data to files, and performing various file-related operations. Python provides built-in functions and methods to perform these tasks efficiently.


## Creating a File in Python Programming Language:
To create a new file in Python, we use the `open()` function with the 'w' mode. It creates a new file if it does not exist or truncates the file if it already exists, allowing writing data to it.Refer to the tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/creating-a-file-in-python">Creating a File in Python</a> to read about the code sample of this section in detail.


## Opening a File in Python Programming Language:
To work with an existing file in Python, we use the `open()` function with different modes such as 'r' (read), 'w' (write), or 'a' (append). The file is opened in the specified mode, allowing various file operations.A detailed explanation of the code samples for this section are included in the tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/opening-a-file-in-python-programming-language">Opening a File</a>.


## Reading a File in Python Programming Language:
To read data from a file in Python, we use the `read()` or `readlines()` methods after opening the file in read mode ('r'). It allows retrieving data from the file for processing or display.The tutorial <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/reading-a-file-in-python-programming-language">Reading a File</a> explains the code sample given above for this section in detail.

## Writing to a File in Python Programming Language:
To write data to a file in Python, we use the `write()` method after opening the file in write mode ('w'). It enables adding content to the file, overwriting any existing data.The tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/writing-to-a-file-in-python-programming-language">Writing to a File</a> gives a better understanding of the code samples for this section.


## Append to a File in Python Programming Language:
To append data to an existing file in Python, we use the `write()` method after opening the file in append mode ('a'). It allows adding new content at the end of the file, preserving the existing data.The step by step tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/append-to-a-file-in-python-programming-language">Append to a File</a> throws more light on the topic and the code samples.


## Check if a File Exists in Python:
To check if a file exists in Python, we use the `os.path.exists()` function from the `os` module. It returns True if the file exists and False otherwise, enabling conditional file operations.The code samples given above for this section are explained in detailed in the tutorial - <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/check-if-a-file-exists-in-python">Check if a File Exists in Python</a>.


## Python Seek() Function:
The `seek()` function in Python is used to change the current file position within an open file. It allows moving the file pointer to a specific position, enabling reading or writing data at a particular location.Thorough understanding of the code for this section can be gained from the <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/python-seek-function">Seek() Function</a> tutorial.


## Rename Files in Python:
To rename files in Python, we use the `os.rename()` function from the `os` module. It allows changing the name of an existing file, providing flexibility in file management and organization.A comprehensive tutorial on the topic <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/rename-files-in-python">Rename Files</a> explains the code samples of this section in more detail.
