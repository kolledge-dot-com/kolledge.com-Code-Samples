## What is Object-Oriented Programming:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes. OOP focuses on data abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It promotes code reusability, modularity, and easier maintenance by representing real-world entities as objects with properties and behaviors.

## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts - OOPs Concepts:
OOPs concepts are the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming. They include classes, objects, encapsulation, data abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. Understanding these concepts is crucial for building scalable, maintainable, and extensible software using OOP.

## What are Classes:
Classes in Object-Oriented Programming are blueprint templates that define the structure and behavior of objects. They act as user-defined data types, containing attributes (data) and methods (functions) that define the object's properties and actions. Classes enable code organization and serve as a blueprint for creating multiple objects of the same type.

## What are Objects:
Objects in Object-Oriented Programming are instances of classes. They represent real-world entities and have attributes that define their state and methods that define their behavior. Objects allow encapsulating data and functionality into a single entity, facilitating code modularity and reuse.

## What is Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is one of the core principles of OOP. It refers to bundling data and methods within a class, restricting direct access to data from outside the class. Encapsulation provides data hiding, preventing unintended modifications and ensuring controlled access to an object's internal state.

## What is Data Abstraction:
Data Abstraction in OOP refers to exposing only relevant information and hiding unnecessary details of an object's implementation. It allows focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it, making code more intuitive and easier to understand.

## What is Inheritance:
Inheritance is a vital OOP concept that allows creating new classes (derived classes) from existing classes (base classes). The derived class inherits properties and behaviors from the base class, promoting code reusability and enabling hierarchical relationships between classes.

## What is Polymorphism:
Polymorphism in OOP allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent multiple data types, providing flexibility and allowing the use of objects interchangeably. Polymorphism enhances code flexibility and maintainability.
