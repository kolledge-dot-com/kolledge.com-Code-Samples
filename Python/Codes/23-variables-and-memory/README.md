# Memory management in python

## Memory References in Python:
In Python, memory references are pointers that indicate the location of objects in memory. Understanding memory references is crucial for memory management, as it helps track how variables refer to objects and how memory is allocated and released during program execution.

## Garbage Collection in Python:
Garbage collection in Python is an automatic memory management process that deallocates memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use. The Python interpreter handles garbage collection, ensuring efficient memory usage and preventing memory leaks.

## Mutable and Immutable Objects in Python:
In Python, objects are classified as mutable or immutable based on whether their state can be changed after creation. Mutable objects allow modifications to their content, while immutable objects remain fixed once created, ensuring data integrity and preventing unintended changes.The tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/mutable-and-immutable-objects-in-python">Mutable and Immutable Objects</a> gives a better understanding of the code samples for this section.


## None Value in Python:
In Python, `None` is a special object used to represent the absence of a value. It is often used as a default return value for functions or to initialize variables. Understanding `None` is essential for handling cases where a value may or may not be present.The step by step tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/none-value-in-python">None Value in Python</a> throws more light on the topic and the code samples.


## How Integers are Stored in Python:
Integers in Python are stored as objects with a fixed amount of memory, which allows them to represent arbitrarily large numbers. Python uses a variable-width integer representation, optimizing memory usage and performance for integer operations.The code samples given above for this section are explained in detailed in the tutorial - <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/how-integers-are-stored-in-python">Storing integers in python</a>.


## How Float is Stored in Python:
Floating-point numbers (floats) in Python are stored as IEEE 754 double-precision binary floating-point format. Python uses 64 bits to represent floats, providing precision and accuracy for a wide range of numeric values. Understanding float representation helps avoid precision-related issues in numerical computations.Thorough understanding of the code for this section can be gained from the <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/how-float-is-stored-in-python">Storing float in python</a> tutorial.
