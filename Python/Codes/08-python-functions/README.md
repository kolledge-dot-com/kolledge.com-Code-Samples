# Python functions


## What are Functions in a Programming Language:
Functions in a programming language are reusable blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks. They help break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces, improving code organization and readability. Functions promote modularity and enable developers to write more maintainable and efficient code.

## Functions in Python:
In Python, functions are defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and a block of code that executes when the function is called. Python functions can have parameters, return values, and are objects that can be assigned to variables. Understanding functions is fundamental for writing structured and efficient Python programs.The step by step tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/functions-in-python-programming-language">Functions in Python</a> throws more light on the topic and the code samples.

## Passing Arguments in Functions in Python:
When calling a Python function, arguments can be passed to it. These arguments provide input values that the function processes during execution. Python functions can receive both positional and keyword arguments, offering flexibility in parameter passing and enabling various use cases.The code samples given above for this section are explained in detailed in the tutorial - <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/passing-arguments-in-functions-in-python-programming-language">Passing Arguments in Functions</a>.

## Default Parameters in Python:
Python functions can have default parameter values assigned to their parameters. If a value is not provided for a parameter during function call, the default value is used instead. Default parameters enhance function flexibility and allow for optional arguments in Python.Thorough understanding of the code for this section can be gained from the <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/default-parameters-in-python-programming-language">Default Parameters</a> tutorial.

## Global and Local Variables in Python Programming Language:
In Python, variables declared outside any function or block have global scope, accessible throughout the entire program. Variables declared within a function have local scope, only accessible within that function. Understanding global and local variables is vital for variable management and preventing naming conflicts.A comprehensive tutorial on the topic <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/global-and-local-variables-in-python-programming-language">Global and Local Variables</a> explains the code samples of this section in more detail.

## Using Global Keyword in Python Programming Language:
Python's `global` keyword allows a function to modify a variable declared in the global scope. Without the `global` keyword, assigning a value to a variable inside a function creates a new local variable. Proper use of the `global` keyword prevents unintended variable shadowing and ensures changes reflect across the entire program.The code samples given above for this section are explained in detailed in a comprehensive tutorial on the topic <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/using-global-keyword-in-python-programming-language">Using Global Keyword in Python</a>.

## Nested Functions in Python Programming Language:
Python supports nesting functions, allowing the creation of functions within functions. These nested functions are known as inner functions and have access to variables in the enclosing (outer) function's scope. Nesting functions facilitates code organization and keeps related functionalities together within a single logical unit.Thorough understanding of the code for this section can be gained from an all inclusive tutorial on the topic <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/nested-functions-in-python-programming-language">Nested Functions</a>.
