# Async i/o in Python

## Event Loop in Python:
The event loop in Python, provided by the `asyncio` module, enables asynchronous programming. It efficiently manages multiple tasks, allowing non-blocking execution and preventing the need for traditional blocking calls. The event loop continuously checks for completed tasks and schedules new ones, making it ideal for handling I/O-bound operations.The step by step tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/event-loop-in-python">Event Loop in Python</a> throws more light on the topic and the code samples.


## Async-Await in Python:
Async-await is a powerful syntactic feature in Python, introduced in Python 3.5, that simplifies asynchronous programming. It allows developers to write asynchronous code in a more sequential and readable manner, making it easier to handle concurrent operations and improve performance.The code samples given above for this section are explained in detailed in the tutorial - <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/async-await-in-python">Async-Await</a>.


## Creating Tasks in Python:
In Python's `asyncio` framework, tasks represent units of work that run concurrently within the event loop. Developers can use `asyncio.create_task()` to create tasks from coroutines, enabling the execution of multiple asynchronous operations simultaneously.Thorough understanding of the code for this section can be gained from the <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/creating-tasks-in-python">Creating Tasks</a> tutorial.


## Canceling Tasks in Python:
In Python, tasks created using `asyncio.create_task()` can be canceled programmatically using the `Task.cancel()` method. Canceling tasks allows graceful termination of asynchronous operations and efficient resource management.A comprehensive tutorial on the topic <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/canceling-tasks-in-python">Canceling Tasks in Python</a> explains the code samples of this section in more detail.


## Asyncio.wait_for() Function in Python:
The `asyncio.wait_for()` function in Python's `asyncio` module allows specifying a timeout for an asynchronous operation. It helps prevent tasks from blocking indefinitely and enables more controlled execution of concurrent operations.The code samples given above for this section are explained in detailed in a comprehensive tutorial on the topic <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/asyncio-wait-for-function-in-python">wait_for() Function in Python</a>.


## Asyncio Future Object in Python:
An asyncio `Future` object in Python represents a result that will be available at some point in the future. It provides a way to manage the result of asynchronous operations and allows waiting for the completion of concurrent tasks.Thorough understanding of the code for this section can be gained from an all inclusive tutorial on the topic <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/asyncio-future-object-in-python">Asyncio Future Object</a>.


## Asyncio.gather() Function in Python:
The `asyncio.gather()` function in Python's `asyncio` module allows executing multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently and waiting for all of them to complete. It enables efficient parallel execution and aggregation of results from multiple coroutines.Refer to an all inclusive tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/asynciogather-function-in-python">gather() Function in Python</a> to read about the code sample of this section in detail.
