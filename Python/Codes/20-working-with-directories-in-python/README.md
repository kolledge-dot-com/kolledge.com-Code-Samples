# Working with directories in python

## Path of a Directory Using os Module:
In Python, the `os` module provides functions for working with operating system-related functionalities. To obtain the path of a directory, we use `os.path.join()` to join directory names and `os.path.abspath()` to get the absolute path. Understanding paths is essential for file and directory operations.The code samples given above for this section are explained in detailed in a comprehensive tutorial on the topic <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/path-of-a-directory-using-os-module-in-python">Path of a Directory</a>.


## Directory Operations Using os Module:
The `os` module in Python allows performing various directory-related operations. It includes functions like `os.mkdir()` to create directories, `os.rmdir()` to remove directories, and `os.listdir()` to list the contents of a directory.Thorough understanding of the code for this section can be gained from an all inclusive tutorial on the topic <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/directory-operations-using-os-module-in-python">Directory Operations</a>.


## Fetch List of Files in a Directory:
To obtain a list of files in a directory using Python, we use the `os.listdir()` function from the `os` module. It returns a list containing the names of files and subdirectories present in the specified directory.Refer to an all inclusive tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/fetch-list-of-files-in-a-directory-in-python">Fetch List of Files in a Directory</a> to read about the code sample of this section in detail.


## Delete Files and Directories in Python:
In Python, we can delete files using the `os.remove()` function and directories using the `os.rmdir()` or `shutil.rmtree()` function from the `os` and `shutil` modules, respectively. Care should be taken while deleting to avoid data loss.Refer to a comprehensive tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/delete-files-and-directories-in-python">Delete Files and Directories</a> to read about the code sample of this section in detail.


## Copy Files and Directories in Python:
Python's `shutil` module provides functions for copying files and directories. The `shutil.copy()` function allows copying single files, while `shutil.copytree()` enables copying entire directories and their contents.A detailed explanation of the code samples for this section are given in an all inclusive tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/copy-files-and-directories-in-python">Copy Files and Directories</a>.


## Move Files and Directories in Python:
Moving files and directories in Python involves using the `shutil.move()` function from the `shutil` module. It allows moving files or directories from one location to another, making it easy to reorganize data.An elaborate tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/move-files-and-directories-in-python">Move Files and Directories</a> gives a better understanding of the code samples for this section.
