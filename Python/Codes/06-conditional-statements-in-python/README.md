# Conditional statements in python


## Conditional Statements in Python programming language:
Conditional statements in Python enable decision-making based on specific conditions. They allow developers to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition evaluates to True or False. Proper use of conditional statements enhances program flexibility and control flow.

## If Statement in Python programming language:
The if statement in Python is the simplest conditional statement. It allows executing a block of code if a given condition is True. If the condition is False, the block is skipped, and the program continues to the next statement. If statements are fundamental for controlling program behavior based on specific conditions. Refer to a comprehensive tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/if-statement-in-python-programming-language">If Statement in Python</a> to read about the code sample of this section in detail.

## If..else Statement in Python:
The if..else statement in Python extends the basic if statement by providing an alternative block of code to execute when the condition evaluates to False. If the initial if condition is True, the if block executes; otherwise, the else block is executed. This construct is used for binary decisions. A detailed explanation of the code samples for this section are given in an all inclusive tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/if-else-statement-in-python">If..else Statement in Python</a>.

## If…elif…else Statement in Python:
The if...elif...else statement in Python allows handling multiple conditions sequentially. It provides a chain of if and elif (short for "else if") statements followed by an optional else block. The program evaluates the conditions in order, executing the first matching block of code. If none of the conditions are met, the else block executes. An elaborate tutorial on <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/if-elif-else-statement-in-python">If…elif…else Statement</a> gives a better understanding of the code samples for this section.

## Ternary Operator in Python:
The ternary operator in Python is a concise way to express conditional expressions in a single line. It has the syntax `value_if_true if condition else value_if_false`. Depending on the condition's evaluation, the operator returns either `value_if_true` or `value_if_false`. The ternary operator is useful for simple conditional assignments and expressions.The code samples given above for this section are explained elaborately in the tutorial on the topic <a href="https://www.kolledge.com/python/tutorial/introduction-to-python-ternary-operator">Ternary Operator</a>.
